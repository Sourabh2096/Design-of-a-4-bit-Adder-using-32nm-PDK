# Design-of-a-4-bit-Adder-using-32nm-PDK
Designed a 4-bit Full Adder circuit using 1-bit mirror adders with inversion logic}              \resumeItem{Verified functionality by simulation using HSPICE testbenches and Wave Viewer, performed DRC/LVS checks on layout}             \resumeItem{Optimized the design for minimum delay and area}
